# Dicee ðŸŽ² (for Flutter 2.x)

This is an updated version of the starter Flutter project for a "Dicee" game, [originally created by London App Brewery](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/dicee-flutter ). To update the code for Flutter 2.x, all that was done was:

1. Created a new project using `flutter create`
2. Copied `main.dart` from the original repo into the new repo
3. Copied the `/images` directory from the original repo into the new repo
4. Added the following to `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
  assets:
    - images/
```
